About this project :   
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenging time for everyone, but we must remember that we are all in this together. The virus is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can cause respiratory tract infections ranging from mild to severe, and can be transmitted through person-to-person contact. It is important to be aware of the symptoms and take precautions to prevent its spread.

Our website has focused on a research study by the ISARIC multinational observational study that examines the variation of COVID-19 symptoms based on age and sex. This study is important in providing a more general understanding of COVID-19 symptoms, which can be useful for medical staff in making diagnoses and predictions related to the disease.

We have also analyzed existing data to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on various age groups, sexes, and people with certain diseases. Our work has helped create awareness of different risk factors and prioritize different sets of people for further action. Additionally, we have created a quiz to help people retain information about COVID-19 prevention and symptoms in an interactive way.

Overall, our goal is to provide useful information to people during this difficult time and help prevent the spread of COVID-19. We encourage everyone to stay informed, take precautions, and work together to beat this virus.

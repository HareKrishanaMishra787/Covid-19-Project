            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your
                nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.

                In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified
                SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.

                COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
                infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory
                tract (windpipe and lungs).

                It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections
                range from mild to deadly.

                SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like
                Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other
                coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for
                otherwise healthy people.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We have selected a concerning research about-"COVID-19 SYMPTOMS AT
                HOSPITAL ADMISSION VARY WITH AGE AND
                SEX:RESULTS FROM THE ISARIC PROSPECTIVE MULTINATIONAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY".
                This research is done by the ISARIC multinational observational study which is about
                the variation of symptoms of covid – 19 cases on the basis of different age groups and on
                the premise of sexual orientation , we will notice that people whose age is over 60 years or
                less than 20 years are experiencing few more symptoms, apart from the typical
                symptoms which is fever, cough and shortness of breath, we also notice that there are
                more proportions of females that are experiencing atypical symptoms as compared to males.
                This research is useful in generalizing the covid – 19 symptoms which are previously
                scattered and that can be really helpful to medical staff for diagnosis and other predictions
                related to this disease.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                We took our problem statement as -"COVID -19 IMPACTS ON VARIOUS AGE GROUPS ,SEX AND PEOPLES
                WITH CERTAIN DISESASES: RISK EVALUATION FROM THE EXISTING DATA".
                We had analyze the existed raw data which we found in this research.First of all it came in the form of
                excell documents, then we analyze the datasheet by using pandas from Python one the basis of: <br>
                Dependencies of gender and age groups :

                Perks of our work:<br>
                ● It helps to create awareness of various age groups.<br>
                ● Identify who are more vulnerable to this disease.<br>
                ● Determine if existing control measures are adequate or if more should
                be done.<br>
                ● Prioritize the different sets of people on the basis of their age, sex and
                what abnormalities they have and take further action.<br>
                ● Prevent the upcoming threat by having prior knowledge of calamity.<br>
